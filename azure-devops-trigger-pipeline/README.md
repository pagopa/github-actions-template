# azure-devops-trigger-pipeline

This action helps to triggers an Azure DevOps pipeline.

## Azure PAT

the PAT which is personal to a user (we still can't have a bot) and must have the following permissions:

* build: read & execute
* code: read
* release: read

## how to use

* `azure_template_parameters` is a json string that will be passed to the Azure DevOps pipeline as parameters.

```yaml
